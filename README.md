# MEAN Stack README

## Overview

The MEAN stack is a popular full-stack JavaScript solution for building dynamic web applications. It comprises four key technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents.
- **Express.js**: A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
- **Angular**: A platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Getting Started

To set up a MEAN stack project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js and npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

2. **Set up MongoDB**: Install MongoDB and ensure it's running on your local machine or use a cloud-based MongoDB service.

3. **Initialize the Project**:

   ```bash
   mkdir my-mean-app
   cd my-mean-app
   npm init -y
   ```

4. **Install Express.js**:

   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

5. **Set up Angular**:

   - Install the Angular CLI globally:
     ```bash
     npm install -g @angular/cli
     ```
   - Create a new Angular project within your MEAN app directory:
     ```bash
     ng new client
     ```

6. **Connect MongoDB with Express**:

   - Install the MongoDB driver for Node.js:
     ```bash
     npm install mongodb
     ```
   - Set up your Express server to connect to MongoDB.

7. **Develop Your Application**:
   - Build your backend API using Express.js and MongoDB.
   - Develop your frontend using Angular.
   - Ensure proper communication between the client and server.
